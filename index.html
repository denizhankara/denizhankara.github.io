          <p>Tobacco use is responsible for 480,000 premature deaths
            each year and almost $300 billion in health care costs.

            A new study from the American Cancer Society reveals that
            smoking is responsible for about one-third of all cancer
            deaths in the nation overall.
            State-level estimates of the number
            of adult deaths from smoking in 2014.
            You can browse the results for different states using the map below.

            Most deaths from smoking occur in older populations.

            see that it is mainly older populations that are affected.Note that
            the share of lower ages increase slightly as the smoking gets more
            and more popular among the younger population over the years.

            Finally, to show the correlation between smoking and cancer in
            various countries, Global Burden of Disease published a detailed report in
            late 20th century. The data provides the number of smoke sales
            per adult per day versus the lung cancer mortalities in late 20th century.
            In many
            countries we see a significant rise,
            peak and then decline in lung cancer death rates
            ,which are driven by the trends in smoking. Browse the different
            country statistics using the dropdown menu and explore the correlation

            Observe that lung
            cancer trends follow the smoking trends with a certain lag.
            Note that the decrease in smoking trends are generally
            more significant in richer countries due to regulations, which are
            followed by even sharper decreases in the lung cancer mortalities.
